## Project Title: Multimodal Video-to-Text Summarizer

### Project Description:
This project develops a multimodal video-to-text summarizer that integrates Computer Vision and NLP to analyze both visual and audio content, generating concise and informative summaries to enhance accessibility and understanding of video material.

### Week 1: Project Kick-off and Planning (In Progress)
**Objective:** Define the project scope and establish goals.  
**Activities:**  
- Conduct an initial meeting with the supervisor to outline project objectives and deliverables.  
- Develop a detailed project plan, including milestones, roles, and responsibilities.

### Week 2-3: Literature Review and Technical Feasibility Study (In Progress)
**Objective:** Understand existing methods in multimodal video summarization and validate the feasibility of the approach.  
**Activities:**  
- Conduct a literature review on video summarization techniques using models like ViViT, BLIP, Whisper, and mbart50.  
- Evaluate the capabilities of these models for integrating visual and textual data to generate summaries.  
- Identify available datasets and assess the need for new data collection.

### Week 4: Data Collection and Preprocessing (In Progress)
**Objective:** Gather and prepare video data for model training.  
**Activities:**  
- Collect relevant educational, news, and legal videos aligned with the projectâ€™s use cases.  
- Preprocess data, including frame extraction using ViViT, audio-to-text conversion with Whisper, and preparing data for multimodal analysis.

### Week 5-6: Model Development - Visual and Textual Analysis
**Objective:** Develop models for visual content analysis and text processing.  
**Activities:**  
- Implement ViViT for video content understanding, focusing on identifying key frames and actions within videos.  
- Use Whisper for high-accuracy speech-to-text conversion and prepare transcripts for further NLP processing.  
- Develop NLP components using mbart50 for multilingual text processing and BLIP for integrating textual and visual data.

### Week 7-8: Multimodal Integration and Initial Testing
**Objective:** Integrate visual and textual components and perform initial testing.  
**Activities:**  
- Combine outputs from ViViT, BLIP, and Whisper to generate concise video summaries.  
- Conduct initial testing to evaluate the effectiveness and coherence of the summaries generated.

### Week 9: Model Optimization and Fine-Tuning
**Objective:** Optimize the multimodal model for improved performance.  
**Activities:**  
- Fine-tune model parameters and optimize integration between ViViT, BLIP, Whisper, and mbart50.  
- Test performance on various video types to ensure adaptability and accuracy.

### Week 10: Evaluation and Documentation
**Objective:** Final evaluation of the system and preparation of project documentation.  
**Activities:**  
- Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, focusing on the quality of the generated summaries across different domains.  
- Document methodologies, findings, and insights, and prepare a presentation or demo for stakeholders.

### Week 11: Application Development and Deployment
**Objective:** Develop a user-friendly application for video summarization.  
**Activities:**  
- Build a front-end interface and integrate APIs for video upload and summary generation.  
- Deploy the application, ensuring it meets performance and usability standards.
