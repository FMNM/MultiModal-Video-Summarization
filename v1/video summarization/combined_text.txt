I was like, 90% not getting it But, after a few weeks the phone was in his hands and he came to me and he told, these people My family, I live in Kutch there was no such gaming scenario but I saw all the streams and I said, I can try this so I took some money and on Instagram I said, Instagram is 100 followers and he said, look, what is the value of the people who follow me? So, I said, if you can try it, you can try it and you can go there You know, the family is like what is the game that you play? What are you getting out of it? So, when you are meeting then tell your family that you are doing the best for the kids let's see The game gets ruined That's what they actually believe Now, when you have a family announcement bootcamp shifting and all they are also seeing they are wasting their time but first they are doing something but first they are doing the nature they are angry they are playing games even if they are playing at home They are like, okay, finally you are doing something and you are going to places and ya Parents, you know, definitely when they started they didn't have a good reaction they were like, they are like, indimparents Now, when I showed them especially, especially after coming to the bootcamp I had called my mom and I showed them the whole bootcamp So, she was like, you know, you are living this life and there is a lot of money but you know, this life, you know they don't get money from them so she was like, you are doing something you love it so, now, you are completely in the bootcamp So, when I started then, I didn't know the parents and you can't say anything because I belong to Gujju family so, they don't believe in this mobile and all this but when I had a chance that I am going to achieve I was going to represent India and go to LHA in WC because of Covid then, I told my dad that I play a gaming game and I will relate to them and he is completely in the way so, Gujju family and Gujju, you are doing a lot of work so, I didn't do anything I said, I will achieve something and then, I was struggling so, I said, I have to go so, then, I was angry and I didn't let go but I was fighting then, I won and I won 32 countries and then, I said, I will go to LHA and represent India so, after that, I called my dad and he said, I won and now, I will get a salary and everything will be fine and we also had a big price so, I won a lot of money and I won so much and mom always supported me mom was very supportive whatever I say because of mom she never supported me for this even when I started earning then, I didn't support my dad my mom didn't support me and then, I told her how to get a salary I spent a lot of time but, one day, when she did a device she did a sponsor and I also took a PC and now, I say that wherever I am now, just like my mom's support so, dad, I was saying, I had to work for foreign major and I was saying, how much work you have earned from YouTube because I had to work for the first time because, I had to make a $2 and then, I told my dad that, I have to make a $120 for that time so, dad, he earned so much and then, he was the only one who earned the money so, it was like that my dad liked it a lot you can say, it's his dream car and, one situation, I asked my dad if I was watching the car so, my dad took me and said, it's a dream it's tough I mean, the car means, it's quite expensive I can't afford it so, at that time, I got something that, how did my dad say so, after a few weeks I went to the showroom booked it the same car that I needed but, it was a little better M-sports that is, sports Dad, I'm going to take the chicks What do you think? Godlike as a team what does he represent? No competition Godlike as a team represents the future of gaming in India for me, it's like representing themself internationally Everything every thing I mean, Godlike, whatever I had seen I didn't see it in India I took the world's Godlike and took it to my top and, yes, which is what we are doing we are all Godlike as a team I think Godlike as a team represents hope future is just dream come true It is coming up in other sectors also like content creation merchandise and everything like you know but, right now Prime is the sports The spirit of the sports is what is it? What is it? You have given your family and friends a virtual tour and, how was their reaction? Family never saw the first time they were not aware of the day they were not aware of it how much it would be they were shocked they were shocked and, they were so big What advice do you give young gamers? Views are not coming 5 views, 10 views, 50, so, they stop they think they are not growing they are not growing they are a bit demotivated so, you are not only not stopping you are doing whatever you want just simple The main focus is that you should never stop just keep one goal that you have to become a gamer just focus on that focus on that sorry don't focus on other things focus on time Firstly, get your basics cleared which is your education your education will be back up even though you want to pursue career in esports you want to become the next Jonathan but, get your basic that is education cleared Start focusing on you know full-time grind because parents don't support so, if you work hard then, you balance it and then, you can play it or, you can grind it in free time you whatever you want to become you will see that is not the way to go you will see that you are growing and you will see and if you are a young gamer then, you will see that you are growing so, don't stop until you achieve you will not achieve Follow the scene whatever you are playing follow the scene how you are going to match which team is going to the top what is he doing? he is doing a different your individual game play work on it to improve your game you need to study the most important thing so, to study you will get the material so, you will get the top teams also, you will also be fighting on the international level or on the national level he is playing all the teams how are you playing? what is he doing? he is doing it he is not going to be ego and, he is going to break then, you will not be able to do it going forward what do you want to see in the industry? the the toxicity and the clean environment i think that is what we need the most like the hackers and all like, people many good players don't get the chance to showcase themselves the their talent just because like, the hackers and all we see in Tony's i think that can be you know, improved and all Chai, how good your kids are doing in these sports growing ahead you get money you get salary but people who say Ngatapazke hilarious nie Dynamical ne WellM Grindr DESecond From more female Roasters with various games in mind.
